## About Fablo

Fablo is a developer-friendly tool for quickly spinning up Hyperledger Fabric networks using Docker. It simplifies network configuration through a single declarative file, making it ideal for:

- **Local development**: Quickly test chaincode and network configurations
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automate Fabric network deployment in testing environments
- **Experimentation**: Try different network topologies without complex manual setup

### Key Features

- **Multi-Version Support**: Hyperledger Fabric v2.x and v3.x
- **Consensus Protocols**: BFT, RAFT, and Solo
- **Developer Experience**:
  - Java chaincode hot reload (dev mode)
  - Mermaid-based network topology visualization
  - Chaincode-as-a-Service (CCaaS) support
  - Network snapshots for saving/restoring states
- **Advanced Features**:
  - REST API integration
  - Advanced topology configuration

## Mentorship Overview

1. **Feature Parity**: Ensure compatibility between Fabric v2 and v3
   - Peer dev mode
   - Network snapshots
   - Channel query scripts

2. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Enhance end-to-end Bash tests
   - Expand Jest test coverage
   - Test various network configurations

3. **Documentation**:
   - Identify documentation gaps
   - Improve existing documentation
   - Add usage examples

4. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Resolve reported issues
   - Improve error handling
   - Enhance stability

## My Learning Journey

When I started this mentorship, I had no prior experience with Hyperledger Fabric or Fablo. I didn't know what Fablo was or what it did.

This mentorship was my first real introduction to blockchain network tooling and Hyperledger Fabric concepts.

### Understanding the Technology Stack

- **Hyperledger Fabric Fundamentals**:
  - Peers, orderers, and channels architecture
  - Chaincode development and deployment
  - Enterprise blockchain network operations

- **Fablo's Core Concepts**:
  - Single configuration file approach
  - Docker container management
  - Network generation process

### Development Environment Setup

- Configured Docker environment
- Set up local development workspace
- Explored existing codebase structure
- Executed test suites to understand coverage

### First Milestone
Early in my journey, I tackled an important issue that had been open: enabling cross-platform testing on macOS (Issue #217). This resulted in my first pull request:

> [feat: Add cross-platform testing on macOS #546](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fablo/pull/546)


This contribution allowed Fablo's test suite to run on different operating systems in GitHub Actions, improving the project's CI/CD pipeline and ensuring broader compatibility. Working on this issue helped me deeply understand Fablo's testing infrastructure and how CI workflows operate in open-source projects.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Network Topology Visualization with Mermaid

> [feat: Export network topology with Mermaid #565](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fablo/pull/565)


**The Problem:**

Complex Hyperledger Fabric networks are difficult to visualize and understand from configuration files alone. Before this feature, Fablo could generate full Fabric networks, but the structure was only defined in YAML/JSON files which were hard to read, difficult to present to team members, and offered no way to visualize how components were connected.

**The Solution:**

I implemented a feature that automatically generates Mermaid diagrams from Fablo network configurations. Now, instead of parsing complex config files, users get a clear visual diagram showing the entire network topology.

Additionally, I enhanced this feature so that diagrams are generated by default with every `fablo generate` command ([#584](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fablo/pull/584)). The topology visualization is automatically created alongside the network configuration.

**Benefits:**

- Better Understanding: Visualize complex network relationships and see how all components (peers, orderers, channels, organizations) are connected at a glance
- Easier Reporting: Instead of embedding raw config files in reports, users can include clean, auto-generated diagrams
- Improved Communication: Share clear, always up-to-date topology diagrams with developers, operators, stakeholders, and newcomers
- Simplified Onboarding: New team members can quickly grasp the network architecture without deciphering configuration files
- Seamless Integration: Diagrams are now generated automatically with every `generate` command, requiring no extra steps

This feature transforms how teams understand, document, and communicate their Hyperledger Fabric network topologies.

### 2. Java Chaincode Development Mode Support

> [feat: Add Java chaincode development mode support #553](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fablo/pull/553)

**The Problem:**

During chaincode development, developers need to frequently modify and test their code. Without development mode, every change requires rebuilding and redeploying the chaincode container a slow and frustrating workflow. While Fablo already supported dev mode for other languages, Java chaincode developers didn't have this option.

**The Solution:**

I implemented Java chaincode development mode (hot reload) support in Fablo. This feature allows Java chaincode developers to run their chaincode outside of the peer container during development, enabling:

- Hot Reload: Make changes to Java chaincode and see them reflected immediately without restarting the entire network
- Faster Development Cycles: No need to rebuild and redeploy containers for every code change
- Easier Debugging: Run chaincode locally with full access to debugging tools and logs
- Consistent Experience: Java developers now have the same streamlined dev workflow as other chaincode languages

This significantly improves the developer experience for teams building Java-based smart contracts on Hyperledger Fabric

### 3. Simplified Init Generator

> [feat: Hardcode fablo config inside init generator #530](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fablo/pull/554)

**The Problem:**

The `fablo init` generator relied on an external JSON config file (__fablo-config-hlf2-1org-1chaincode.json__) that needed to be copied into the Docker image during the build process. This added unnecessary complexity to the Dockerfile and the initialization flow.

**The Solution:**

I simplified the init generator in `src/init/index.ts` by hardcoding the default configuration directly into the source code. This eliminated the need to copy external config files in the Dockerfile, resulting in a cleaner build process and more maintainable codebase.

### 4. Feature: Enhanced Connection Profile with Orderers and Channels

> [feat: Add orderers and channels in connection profile #595](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fablo/pull/595)

**The Problem:**

The generated connection profile had several issues that prevented Node.js clients from working correctly when service discovery was disabled (e.g., in dev mode):

1. CA URL incorrectly used http:// even when TLS was enabled (should be https://)
2. Missing orderers section: required when service discovery is disabled
3. Missing channels section: also required when service discovery is disabled

These issues made it impossible for client applications to connect properly without service discovery.
**The Solution:**

I fixed the connection profile generator to:

- Correctly handle TLS: CA URLs now use https:// when TLS is enabled
- Include orderers section: Added the required orderer information for non-service-discovery scenarios
- Include channels section: Added channel configuration needed for proper client connectivity
